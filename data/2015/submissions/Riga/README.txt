Nondeterministic choices in the transformation are parameterized to produce 
an ensemble of 4 parses which afterwards are joined through voting. Voting adds also the
fifth parse from the modified C6.0 based FrameNet frame-element labeler [3]. The sense column is filled using the modified C6.0 based FrameNet target labeler [3].        important features:         ===================

Voting distinguishes between values "_" and "do_not_know" produced by the C6.0 based frame-element labeler, which is restricted to consider only edges of length up to 4.
Run 2 is the complete one. Run 1 uses for voting one parse less.        critical tools used:         ====================MateTools graph-based dependency parser [1], https://code.google.com/p/mate-tools/Optimized C6.0 classifier [3], http://c60.ailb.lv        data pre- or post-processing: none        =============================        additional data used: none (we participate in the closed task only)        =====================Bibliographic references========================[1] Bernd Bohnet. 2010.
